    <h3> Graphical Security Models and Their Applications </h3>

    <p> <b>Abstract:</b>
    Graphical security models—such as attack graphs, attack trees, and Hierarchical Attack Representation Models (HARMs)—are widely used for threat, attack, and security modeling and analysis. This talk introduces their core concepts, including key terminology, security metrics, and the model life cycle. It then highlights recent advances in graphical modeling techniques and their applications, with a focus on domains such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and the security and safety analysis of autonomous vehicles.
