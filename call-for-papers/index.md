# Scope

Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are a class of engineering systems where computation and communication interact with physical processes, providing complex, situation-aware, and often safety-, security-, or mission-critical ecosystems and services. The fast increase and availability of communication bandwidth and computational power, as well as emerging computing paradigms such as Cloud Computing, Edge Computing, and Deep Learning, are pushing forward CPS research and development, and establishing them as promising engineering solutions to address challenges arising in areas as diverse as aerospace, automotive, energy, disaster response, health care, smart farming, manufacturing, city management, among others.

A key property that CPS are expected to exhibit is that of dependability, that is, the ability to provide services that can be trusted within well determined time-periods, and equally important, that those service guarantees hold even when the system is subject to faults and attacks. A key ingredient to ensure dependability is thus to successfully apply verification & validation (V&V) techniques and attest the desired levels of safety, security, and privacy. Here V&V refers to the process of determining whether the requirements for a system or component are complete and correct, the products of each development phase fulfil the requirements or conditions imposed by the previous phase, and the final system or component complies with the specified requirements.  This is a challenging task that comes with significant time and cost implications for all the organizations involved in the build-up and evaluation of CPS. This challenge becomes even more critical with the incorporation of more and more Artificial Intelligence models into the operational capabilities of CPS for handling tasks that are increasingly complex.

The VERDI workshop aims at serving as a discussion forum focused on the area of V&V as a means to guarantee dependability of complex, potentially automated/autonomous CPS. 

The first edition of the workshop was supported by the ECSEL Joint Undertaking [VALU3S project](https://valu3s.eu/), which ended in July 2023. The second and this edition of the workshop was and will be supported by the EU-funded [AGRARSENSE project](https://www.agrarsense.eu/), a key initiative under the Chips Joint Undertaking, takes agricultural and forestry related productivity to the next level. The consortium will develop state-of-the-art technologies in electronic components and systems for future needs, building European resilience in critical sectors and strongly contribute to sustainability targets and climate change mitigation. In this collaborative effort, small, mid-sized, and large enterprises alongside Research and Technology Organizations (RTOs) will focus on developing innovative solutions in sensors, software, connectivity, and data management, with a keen emphasis on safety, security, and reliability, as well as advancing autonomous movement and robotics platforms.


# Topics

The workshop covers all aspects related to the dependability evaluation (with special focus on __safety__ and __security__) of safety-critical CPS using techniques such as fault/attack-injection, runtime verification, formal verification, semi-formal analysis, simulation, and testing. Topics include, but are not limited to:

 - Safety/security risk assessment and assurance 
 - Analysis of threats and vulnerabilities 
 - In-the-loop and model-based analysis and assessment 
 - Architecture-driven assurance of safety and security 
 - Interplay between safety and security 
 - AI for safety/security and safety/security for AI 
 - Tools for validation and verification 
 - Verification and validation of LLM-enhanced systems 
 - Dependability analysis using simulation and experimental measurement 
 - Methods for qualification, assurance, and certification 
 - Test space exploration and test space pruning 
 - Distributed and real-time monitoring and control 
 - Analysis of probabilistic, real-time, or hybrid systems
