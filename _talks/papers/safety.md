Industry and academia are rapidly moving towards the
development of next-generation Autonomous Driving (AD)
systems. These AD systems are expected to be equipped with
novel AI algorithms to perform several complex tasks,
ranging from object detection and path planning to control
decisions and cloud communication. However, safety is of
utmost importance in such systems because errors, including
AI decision errors, e.g., object detection failure, traffic
light detection error, speed limit violations, etc., can
lead to catastrophic consequences. This paper presents a
safety-centric architecture for building dependable AD
systems. Specifically, we introduce the concept of Adaptive
Safe State Manager to identify potential safety risks in
the AD system and activate respective fail-safe mechanisms
to prevent safety hazards. The proposed architecture is
aligned with industrial safety standards such as ISO 26262
and ISO 21448.
