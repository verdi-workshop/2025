Cyber-physical systems (CPS) rely on software that contains
vulnerabilities and is connected to the public internet.
Internet connectivity exposes CPS to adversaries, who can
exploit vulnerabilities and cause CPS to operate in unsafe
ways, thus compromising safety and liveness requirements.
By formally designing safety and liveness requirements and
synthesizing software that adheres to these specifications,
unsafe behaviors can be prevented from the very beginning
of system development. This paper presents initial results
from ongoing research aimed at enabling the synthesis of
software that controls CPS, ensuring dependability from the
outset.
