Analyzing empirical dependability data now exceeds domain
experts' capabilities without adequate machine support.
This is due to the complexity of modern IT systems, their
many interdependent features, and the extensive time series
involved.

This paper presents a model-driven approach to Exploratory
Data Analysis (EDA), which is guided by formal logic
reasoning over an abstract data model. This supports domain
experts in formulating and validating hypotheses, as well
as guiding the exploration process.

Observations are transformed into qualitative abstractions,
facilitating Answer Set Programming (ASP) based formal
reasoning over system behavior and dependencies.
Counterexample-guided inductive learning (CEGIL) and Rough
Set Theory (RST) are used for iterative hypothesis
refinement and uncertainty management.

The integrated framework enables precise, transparent, and
systematic dependability assessment using commonsense
engineering principles, thereby assisting analysts in the
evaluation process with pertinent expert insights.
